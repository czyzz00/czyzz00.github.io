                    <p>Tentacus is a collective embodiment experiment in mixed reality. Each performer wears a lightweight glove interface, enabling haptic with a shared digital layer. Through a left-hand network (symbolizing continuity) and right-hand exploration (symbolizing distributed agency), Tentacus models a decentralized intelligence system — inspired by the octopus and its limbic cognition — to challenge human-centric notions of coordination, control, and selfhood.</p>

                            <p><strong>Tactile Vibration Simulation in Real-Time and Virtual Environments</strong></p>
                            <p>To simulate a shared haptic experience within a hybrid physical-virtual environment, a tactile feedback mechanism was implemented. When a participant makes contact with a real-world object, vibrotactile signals are transmitted to the handheld devices of the adjacent participants, thereby conveying the sensation of environmental interaction. Each participant wears a smartphone on their hand, with visual perception intentionally occluded, to simulate the exploratory behavior of an octopus tentacle. This setup enables indirect perception through distributed tactile cues and supports the investigation of embodied multisensory interaction under constrained visual conditions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Tentacus is realized through an interactive mixed reality performance system that combines wearable gloves, real-time environmental sensing, and a shared feedback protocol.</strong></p>
                            <p>Each performer wears gloves embedded in a smartphone that acts as both a tracker and a haptic device. Blindfolded participants explore the space with their right hand while their left hand maintains a constant physical connection with neighboring performers, forming a closed loop. The environment was pre-scanned by a depth camera with LiDAR and reconstructed using Gaussian stitching. When a participant's hand intersects with a virtual object, vibrational feedback is sent to neighboring users, thus simulating distributed sensing. Meanwhile, the collective interaction builds a shared Gaussian world on the audience-facing display, and the system renders a Gaussian model of the world in real time, which is built incrementally based on the team's collective haptic experience. This emergent world reflects the inner state of Tentacus as an organism: an environment that is not outwardly visible, but rather realized through concrete collaboration.</p>

                    <p><strong>Biomimetic Wearable Device for Distributed Haptic Perception</strong></p>
                    <p>A biomimetic wearable device inspired by octopus tentacle morphology was designed to simulate distributed tactile perception under visually occluded conditions. The system integrates a smartphone-mounted haptic module (P2), fixed onto the dorsal side of the hand using a soft, adjustable strap structure. The smartphone functions both as a computing and vibrotactile feedback unit, enabling real-time interaction between users. The sleeve-like enclosure houses multiple passive suction elements along the forearm, mimicking the texture and flexibility of cephalopod limbs to enhance the embodied experience. This wearable configuration facilitates indirect environmental sensing and supports investigations into multisensory feedback within spatially distributed interaction systems.</p>

                        <p>This work presents an immersive experiential installation centered on collective tactile perception. The installation situates eight participants around a central, large-scale biomimetic octopus brain ring structure, which serves as a soft, bionic sensory organ symbolizing a shared consciousness system. Each participant physically supports the central structure with their left hand, creating a symbiotic bodily network that embodies multi-agent collaborative resonance in perception. This physical connection transcends mere support, representing a metaphorical link between individual bodies and a collective sensory system.</p>

                    <p>Simultaneously, participants' right hands remain free to explore the surrounding space, interacting with dispersed tactile sensing devices. These exploratory interactions are continuously recorded and dynamically visualized via real-time light and shadow changes on adjacent screens. This visualization forms a tangible feedback loop bridging individual actions and collective neural-like responses.</p>
